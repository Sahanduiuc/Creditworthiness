# Creditworthiness
R and KnitR code to produce results found in "Credit Scoring via Logistic Regression" (http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/~ali/papers/creditworthinessProject.pdf)

The main file to run is logisticRegression.Rnw which produces the .tex and .pdf files that make up the document. This requires KnitR which is a package that allows R code to be weaved with TeX code to produce output efficiently. 

For convenience, the code to produce the results alone (without the .tex and .pdf files) is isolated in main_script.R
